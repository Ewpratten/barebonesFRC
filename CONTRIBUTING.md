# How to Contribute
Below, you can find the rules for pull requests and code reviews

## Creating your own branch
The only general rule for branch is to give your branches sensible names. 5024 members should refer to **the manual** for more rules specifically for the team.

## Protecting your branch (5024 only)
If you would like to protect your branch from other people merging into it without your permission, **add** the following to the bottom of the `CODEOWNERS` file in your branch
```
src/*       @<your username here>
```
